
Read this first!

You can just click the numbers one after another and it'll toggle the switch in the toolkit ( - means it'll get removed, + it'll stay)

Don't click them too fast after one another or it won't register, you can see the window blinking when it registers

if the list is that long it has to use double digit numbers you have to type them like  01  and then press enter

some elements depend on others, disabling one of the parent features disables the child features automatically

but it's a pain to compare each line from the list and the toolkit and see if its already - or + so i marked them to make it easier

lines marked with * mean they should already be disabled by something else you chose before,
so don't click them or you'll enable them (and possibly their parents) again

lines with a leading ! mean its something you might not want to turn off
aka better not touch them, most of them are in some way needed for windows store functionality

try to not make any typos... sure you can just turn it on / off again but if its related to some other setting you might have to check all the other settings again

yea sorry its not exactly one click,.. making a list was the best I could do
